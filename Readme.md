# S3LightFixes

S3LightFixes is a descendant of [Waza-lightfixes](https://modding-openmw.com/mods/waza_lightfixes/), which itself is a descendant of [Lightfixes.pl](https://modding-openmw.com/tips/custom-shaders/#lightfixes-plugin) by vtastek. All three applications are designed to make ESP files which adjust the lighting values from *all* mods listed in one's openmw.cfg. 

In other words, make light gud. What sets this version apart is that it's a standalone binary application, instead of piggybacking off tes3cmd. The changes it makes are the same as the previous two, but with additional conveniences like automatic installation and support for portable installs of OpenMW, and itself having greater portability.

# Usage

Just download the executable for your OS and run it however's most convenient. Double-click it or run it through the terminal or whatever.

That's it. Just go check for the `S3LightFixes.omwaddon` in the launcher. If it's there, everything worked. If it's not, a giant error message should have appeared in your face.

If you have to do anything else, if you *think* you have to do anything else, if it's not Just Working with almost no input from you at all - ask for help.

That's it.

Go away.
